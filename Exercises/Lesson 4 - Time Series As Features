Not every product family has sales showing cyclic behavior, and neither does the series of average sales. Sales of school and office supplies, however, show patterns of growth and decay
not well characterized by trend or seasons. In this question and the next, you'll model cycles in sales of school and office supplies using lag features.

Trend and seasonality will both create serial dependence that shows up in correlograms and lag plots. To isolate any purely cyclic behavior, we'll start by deseasonalizing the series.
Use the code in the next cell to deseasonalize Supply Sales. We'll store the result in a variable y_deseason.

****************
supply_sales = family_sales.loc(axis=1)[:, 'SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES']
y = supply_sales.loc[:, 'sales'].squeeze()

fourier = CalendarFourier(freq='M', order=4)
dp = DeterministicProcess(
    constant=True,
    index=y.index,
    order=1,
    seasonal=True,
    drop=True,
    additional_terms=[fourier],
)
X_time = dp.in_sample()
X_time['NewYearsDay'] = (X_time.index.dayofyear == 1)

model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False)
model.fit(X_time, y)
y_deseason = y - model.predict(X_time)
y_deseason.name = 'sales_deseasoned'

ax = y_deseason.plot()
ax.set_title("Sales of School and Office Supplies (deseasonalized)");
****************

Does this deseasonalized series show cyclic patterns? To confirm our intuition, we can try to isolate cyclic behavior using a moving-average plot just like we did with trend. The idea
is to choose a window long enough to smooth over short-term seasonality, but short enough to still preserve the cycles.

<1st step: Plotting cycles>
Create a seven-day moving average from y, the series of supply sales. Use a centered window, but don't set the min_periods argument.

****************
# YOUR CODE HERE
y_ma = y.rolling(7, center=True).mean()

# Plot
ax = y_ma.plot()
ax.set_title("Seven-Day Moving Average");

# Check your answer
q_1.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_1.hint()
q_1.solution()

Hint:
Your solution should look like:
y_ma = y.rolling(____, center=____).____()

ax = y_ma.plot()
ax.set_title("Seven-Day Moving Average");

Solution:
y_ma = y.rolling(7, center=True).mean()

ax = y_ma.plot()
ax.set_title("Seven-Day Moving Average");
****************

Do you see how the moving average plot resembles the plot of the deseasonalized series? In both, we can see cyclic behavior indicated. Let's examine our deseasonalized series for serial
dependence. Take a look at the partial autocorrelation correlogram and lag plot.

****************
plot_pacf(y_deseason, lags=8);
plot_lags(y_deseason, lags=8, nrows=2);
****************

<2nd step: Examine serial dependence in Store Sales>
Are any of the lags significant according to the correlogram? Does the lag plot suggest any relationships that weren't apparent from the correlogram? After you've thought about your
answer, run the next cell.

****************
# View the solution (Run this cell to receive credit!)
q_2.check()

Correct:
The correlogram indicates the first lag is likely to be significant, as well as possibly the eighth lag. The lag plot suggests the effect is mostly linear.
****************

Recall from the tutorial that a leading indicator is a series whose values at one time can be used to predict the target at a future time -- a leading indicator provides "advance
notice" of changes in the target.

The competition dataset includes a time series that could potentially be useful as a leading indicator -- the onpromotion series, which contains the number of items on a special
promotion that day. Since the company itself decides when to do a promotion, there's no worry about "lookahead leakage"; we could use Tuesday's onpromotion value to forecast sales on
Monday, for instance.

Use the next cell to examine leading and lagging values for onpromotion plotted against sales of school and office supplies.

****************
onpromotion = supply_sales.loc[:, 'onpromotion'].squeeze().rename('onpromotion')

# Drop days without promotions
plot_lags(x=onpromotion.loc[onpromotion > 1], y=y_deseason.loc[onpromotion > 1], lags=3, leads=3, nrows=1);
****************

<3rd step: Examine time series features>
Does it appear that either leading or lagging values of onpromotion could be useful as a feature?

****************
q_3.check()

Correct:
The lag plot indicates that both leading and lagged values of onpromotion are correlated with supply sales. This suggests that both kinds of values could be useful as features. There
may be some non-linear effects as well.
****************

<4th step: Create time series features>
Create the features indicated in the solution to Question 3. If no features from that series would be useful, use an empty dataframe pd.DataFrame() as your answer.

****************
# YOUR CODE HERE: Make features from `y_deseason`
X_lags = make_lags(y_deseason, lags=1)

# YOUR CODE HERE: Make features from `onpromotion`
# You may want to use `pd.concat`
X_promo = pd.concat([
    make_lags(onpromotion, lags=1),
    onpromotion,
    make_leads(onpromotion, leads=1),
], axis=1)

X = pd.concat([X_lags, X_promo], axis=1).dropna()
y, X = y.align(X, join='inner')

# Check your answer
q_4.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_4.hint()
q_4.solution()

Hint:
Your solution should look like:
X_lags = make_lags(y_deseason, lags=____)

X_promo = pd.concat([
    make_lags(onpromotion, lags=____),
    onpromotion,
    make_leads(onpromotion, leads=____),
], axis=1)

X = pd.concat([X_time, X_lags, X_promo], axis=1).dropna()
y, X = y.align(X, join='inner')

Solution:
X_lags = make_lags(y_deseason, lags=1)

X_promo = pd.concat([
    make_lags(onpromotion, lags=1),
    onpromotion,
    make_leads(onpromotion, leads=1),
], axis=1)

X = pd.concat([X_time, X_lags, X_promo], axis=1).dropna()
y, X = y.align(X, join='inner')
****************

Use the code in the next cell if you'd like to see predictions from the resulting model.

****************
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=30, shuffle=False)

model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False).fit(X_train, y_train)
y_fit = pd.Series(model.predict(X_train), index=X_train.index).clip(0.0)
y_pred = pd.Series(model.predict(X_valid), index=X_valid.index).clip(0.0)

rmsle_train = mean_squared_log_error(y_train, y_fit) ** 0.5
rmsle_valid = mean_squared_log_error(y_valid, y_pred) ** 0.5
print(f'Training RMSLE: {rmsle_train:.5f}')
print(f'Validation RMSLE: {rmsle_valid:.5f}')

ax = y.plot(**plot_params, alpha=0.5, title="Average Sales", ylabel="items sold")
ax = y_fit.plot(ax=ax, label="Fitted", color='C0')
ax = y_pred.plot(ax=ax, label="Forecast", color='C3')
ax.legend();

Winners of Kaggle forecasting competitions have often included moving averages and other rolling statistics in their feature sets. Such features seem to be especially useful when used
with GBDT algorithms like XGBoost.

In Lesson 2, you learned how to compute moving averages to estimate trends. Computing rolling statistics to be used as features is similar except we need to take care to avoid lookahead
leakage. First, the result should be set at the right end of the window instead of the center -- that is, we should use center=False (the default) in the rolling method. Second, the
target should be lagged a step.

<5th step: Create statistical features>
Edit the code in the next cell to create the following features:
1} 14-day rolling median (median) of lagged target
2} 7-day rolling standard deviation (std) of lagged target
3} 7-day sum (sum) of items "on promotion", with centered window

****************
y_lag = supply_sales.loc[:, 'sales'].shift(1)
onpromo = supply_sales.loc[:, 'onpromotion']
​
# 28-day mean of lagged target
mean_7 = y_lag.rolling(7).mean()
# YOUR CODE HERE: 14-day median of lagged target
median_14 = y_lag.rolling(14).median()
# YOUR CODE HERE: 7-day rolling standard deviation of lagged target
std_7 = y_lag.rolling(7).std()
# YOUR CODE HERE: 7-day sum of promotions with centered window
promo_7 = onpromo.rolling(7, center=True).sum()
​
# Check your answer
q_5.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
q_5.hint()
q_5.solution()

Hint:
Your code should look like:
y_lag = supply_sales.loc[:, 'sales'].shift(1)
onpromo = supply_sales.loc[:, 'onpromotion']

mean_7 = y_lag.rolling(7).____()
median_14 = y_lag.rolling(____).median()
std_7 = y_lag.rolling(____).____()
promo_7 = onpromo.rolling(____, center=True).____()

Solution:
y_lag = supply_sales.loc[:, 'sales'].shift(1)
onpromo = supply_sales.loc[:, 'onpromotion']

mean_7 = y_lag.rolling(7).mean()
median_14 = y_lag.rolling(14).median()
std_7 = y_lag.rolling(7).std()
promo_7 = onpromo.rolling(7, center=True).sum()
